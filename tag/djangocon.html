<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>My name is Mark Steadman, and sometimes I feel - like certainly now - like a
deer on ice, just kind of panicking, scrabbling around.</p>
<p>I'm on my own here in Poland, I'm blind, so this is all quite a fun little
experience trying to get my head around the place, and I'm going to try and
battle through this really quickly as time is of the essence.</p>
<p>One of the really nice things I've discovered about Poland is that I really like
pierogis. And this is a cat that looks like a pierogi.</p>
<p><img alt="Pierogi cat" src="http://www.highplainssigh.com/images/pierogi.jpg" /></p>
<p>So obviously that's got to be done.</p>
<p>Don't clap, you're eating up my time!</p>
<p>But I have a problem, obviously. I suck at people stuff. I'm really bad; I can
sort of manage like a group of 5, 10 people maybe, and after that I just start
to panic and everything just becomes "huh?" and I'm really frightened and geeky
and scared and shy.</p>
<p>And that also means that I kind of suck at communities. I've been doing a fair
bit on the web for ages and have never really been part of anything. So to give
you a little bit of background: I've been using Django since around 2009. In
2010 I was number 6 in Django Dash, and that was a project that I was basically
the sort of lead solo guy; all the other guys were teams. And also I built in
2008 and refactored something called TweetPaste which got used by the Guardian
in the UK and was recognised by Twitter.</p>
<p>So I say this not as some kind of boasting thing. I'm merely trying to say that
I do stuff, but I'm sort of really crap at being... at joining in.</p>
<p>The thing I'm doing at the moment is something called Nymbol, and it's a mobile
CMS for physical objects. And I've got a toolset that I've built called Bambu
Tools, and it's basically just this gargantuan list of reusable apps that do
basically... I had a raft of ideas for ages, of stuff that I wanted to build and
I would have all these little ideas, and I started building up this massive
toolset that meant I could just go bang out an idea and all I had to build was
the idea itself. And if I wanted to productise that or commoditise it, I could
really easily, because I had everything, theoretically in place without much
configuration.</p>
<p>And the problem is, I'm kind of a nice guy, right? I try and do things the right
way. But we have some issues. So please don't attack me when I say that I've got
these things, there's no internationalisation which means there's no
localisation, there's no documentation, there aren't any tests; there's all
these things wrong with it, and that's simply because I haven't yet been at the
stage where I'm thinking I want to contribute to the community; this is just
stuff that's run for me.</p>
<p>Now I know that that's kind of unacceptable, but what I'm sort of trying to do
now is to stop doing it wrong and to start making a promise, and so I wanted to
make a little promise.</p>
<p>This is a little video I made ages ago and it incapsulated this feeling of hope
and if you give hope a helping hand, then it can achieve some awesome things. So
there's been a lot of talk at this conference about how the Django community and
Python communities are fantastic and inclusive and there are great things we
can do and I want to really be a part of that, so obviously I've signed up for
the introduction to committing tomorrow, at the sprints, so I'm going to do my
utmost to be a real, functioning, valuable member of the community. So thank you
very much.</p>
