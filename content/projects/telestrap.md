Summary: Bootstrap for the Teletext generation
Category: Projects

This is a Bootstrap theme with a [Teletext-style font](http://www.fonts2u.com/teletext-regular-regular.font),
inspired by the text services we used to get before the Web and digital TV
ruined everything.

It's pretty much just a novely project, so don't expect much support :)
