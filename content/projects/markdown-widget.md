Summary: Allows authors to enter text using the Markdown syntax in the sidebar

This plugin allows users familiar with the Markdown syntax to use it from within
the sidebar. Its chief benefit is that it allows users who are unfamiliar with
HTML, to get many of the benefits of a robust markup language, which is easier
to learn and read back.
