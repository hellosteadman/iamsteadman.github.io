Summary: A JavaScript templating framework
Tags: javascript
Category: Projects

Plunja is a simple JavaScript templating system that takes blocks of HTML stored
in `<script>` tags and renders them with context objects. It was inspired by
[Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/).

You don’t need a JavaScript framework to use it, as you can define your own
custom locator (ie: a way of finding the template from the DOM). The built-in
locator uses jQuery, but it’s really simple to define your own.
