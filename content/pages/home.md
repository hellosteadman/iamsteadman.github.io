I'm a full-stack developer with 15 years experience developing for the web, and
an avid Django developer since 2008.

I've built MVPs for startups, large and complex systems for the UK education
primary sector, content management systems and social networks in Django.

I formed [Nymbol](https://nymbol.co.uk/) in 2011 and built it from a prototype
to a large-scale mobile CMS that lists nationally-recognised libraries, museums,
art galleries and heritage organisations as its clients. Every piece of code
inside Nymbol - from the HTML to the Python in the Django app, and many of the
reusable apps it relies upon - were written by me.

I also run a podcasting network called [Poddle](https://poddle.io/), which is
built with Django and hosted via Heroku.

I also work daily with Sass, LESS, HTML5 and jQuery. I alos write microservices
in Flask, and build websites and plugins using WordPress.

I currently work for Substrakt in Birmingham, a passionate digital studio which
focuses on user-experience.
