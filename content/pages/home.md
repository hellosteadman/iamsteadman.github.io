I'm a full-stack developer with 15 years experience developing for the web, and
an avid Django developer since 2008.

I've built MVPs for startups, large and complex systems for the UK primary
education sector, content management systems and social networks in Django.

I formed [Nymbol](https://nymbol.co.uk/) in 2011 and built it from a prototype
to a large-scale mobile CMS that lists nationally-recognised libraries, museums,
art galleries and heritage organisations as its clients. Every piece of code
inside Nymbol - from the HTML to the Python in the Django app, and many of the
reusable apps it relies upon - was written by me.

I also run a podcasting network called [Poddle](https://poddle.io/), which is
built with Django and hosted via Heroku.

I also work daily with Sass, LESS, HTML5 and jQuery, and write microservices in
Flask, and build websites and plugins using WordPress.

I work for [Substrakt](http://substrakt.com/) in Birmingham, a passionate
digital studio which focuses on user-experience.
